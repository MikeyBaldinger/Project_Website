    <h2>About the Site</h2>

    <p>Most NFL databases provide an excessive amount of statistics. In reality, people only care about
        the skill players: quarterbacks, running backs, wide receivers, and tight ends. This web
        application only provides key statistics (eg. passing yards, rushing yards, touchdowns, etc.) for
        those skill players. This is to allow fantasy owners the opportunity to review a particular player's
        stats from the past season to make an informed decision for the upcoming season. This database allows
        such owners to obtain the important statistics they are looking for quickly and efficiently.</p>
